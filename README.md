**Vicinae** (pronounced _"vih-SIN-ay"_) is a high-performance, native launcher for your desktop — built with C++ and Qt.

It comes with a rich set of built-in modules and can be easily extended using the [Typescript SDK](https://docs.vicinae.com/extensions/introduction).

Drawing inspiration from the [Raycast launcher](https://www.raycast.com/), Vicinae provides a mostly compatible extension API, allowing reuse of many existing Raycast extensions with minimal modification.

Vicinae is designed for developers and power users who want fast, keyboard-first access to common system actions.

We can't show everything in the demo, far from it, so please [go read the docs](https://docs.vicinae.com)!

## Breaking changes

Until we reach version 1 you should expect breaking changes from release to release. Watch the changelogs to learn about them.

We try to not introduce breaking changes that result in a definitive loss of data, but you should expect to have to redo your configuration from time to time.
